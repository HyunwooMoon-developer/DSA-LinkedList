Analyze the following function (without running it in an IDE) to determine what problem it is trying to solve.
 What is the time complexity of this algorithm?

 function WhatDoesThisProgramDo(lst) {
    let current = lst.head;
    while (current !== null) {
        let newNode = current;
        while (newNode.next !== null) {
            if (newNode.next.value === current.value) {
                newNode.next = newNode.next.next;
            }
            else {
                newNode = newNode.next;
            }
        }
        current = current.next;
    }
}

A) O(n^2) Polynomial time : The easiest way to understand polynomial time complexity is with nested loops. An algorithm that requires 2 levels of looping over an input would be O(n^2) while one requiring 3 levels of looping would be O(n^3).
