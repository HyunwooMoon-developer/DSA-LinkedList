# Working with Linked Lists

## Linked Lists

data structures that overcome the problems by allocating blocks of memory on demand. These blocks of memory are connected by a mechanism called 'linking'.

The unit of memory holding a single item in a linked list is a 'node' in the list. A node can be allocated from anywhere in the memory, it doesn't have to be next to the previously allocated node. Hence, linked lists are stored in non-contiguous blocks of memory.

## Singly Linked List

Each node consists of a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence.

## Doubly Linked List

Nodes contain a ponter to the previous node in addition to the next.
